Others think that the dam is a way of spending taxpayers\' money to protect illegal residents of the floodplain, and it would destroy the natural river shore. They suggest refurbishing the old dam system instead.","order":1},{"id":"102","name":"Liget project","question":"Construction works at Városliget has to be finished according to the current plans.","description":"Supporters of the project say that creating a museum district at Városliget would improve the situation of museums in Budapest, and would serve as a new tourist attraction. Others think that the area of Városliget should not be taken over by huge buldings and tourists, but should serve as a public park. This is the last chance to stop the construction.","order":2},{"id":"103","name":"Piers (Rakpart)","question":"In the inner districts of Pest and Buda, the pier should be left to pedestrians and a direct connection between the city and the river should be established.","description":"Many people find it unacceptable that opportunities offered by the Danube remain unexploited in the inner city, due to the heavy traffic along the river. Others think the piers serve as essential traffic routes of the city. ","order":3},{"id":"104","name":"Architectural heritage","question":"Regulation protecting architectural heritage in Budapest should become stricter.","description":"Some say there needs to be tighter control over the preservation of Budapest\'s architectural heritage (e.g. insulation reconstruction, demolishing and restoring old buildings in a professional manner), even if it goes against the interests of investors. Others say that protecting monuments cannot act as a barrier to city- and property development.","order":4},{"id":"105","name":"Congestion charge","question":"A congestion charge should be introduced as soon as possible.","description":"Budapest agreed to introduce an extra fee to reduce traffic.

According to organizations representing the interests of cyclists, building a bike path along the Nagykörút is essential. Others say such a path cannot be built, taking into consideration current traffic conditions, and the fact that traffic and parking would become much more cumbersome.","order":6},{"id":"107","name":"BKK (public transportation) outsourcing","question":"The outsourcing of BKK bus services to external service providers should be continued.","description":"It is possible to modernize the public transportation car park by outsourcing the lines to external service providers as they themselves are responsible for the new vehicles.

Others say it is not the city\'s competence (but the districts\' or government\'s) to deal with housing issues.","order":9},{"id":"110","name":"Ban on homeless people","question":"Homelessness is primarily a police matter.","description":"Some think that people living on the streets negatively impact the picture of a city.

Others say drug prevention is not the police\'s task and professional organizations with a ministerial recommendation should hold lectures about health and addiction.","order":15},{"id":"116","name":"Municipality owned companies","question":"The best owner of the public service companies of Budapest is the city.","description":"Some say the privatization of public utility companies caused great loss for the city and its inhabitants, they should be kept in municipal hands for long term. Others think public authorities are not good managers, private investors can operate these companies more efficiently, the city should only create proper regulation.","order":16},{"id":"117","name":"Electoral system","question":"The municipal election system  for Budapest is broken; it makes it difficult to implement city wide policies.","description":"Unlike the pre-2014 system, voters cannot directly decide on composition of the City Council, since representatives are selected based on votes on the Budapest mayor, district mayors and the compensation list. As there can be five or six-fold differences between the population of districts, voters of smaller districts have a stronger representation than citizens living in big ones.","order":17},{"id":"118","name":"Party district","question":"The introduction of mandatory closing time at midnight for pubs and bars would be the solution to complaints of citizens living in the \\"party district\\".","description":"Those campaigning for closing hours at midnight want to make their neighborhood calmer and more livable.

Others think it should be improved to include better bikes and cover new areas of operation.","order":22},{"id":"123","name":"Subsidies for theaters","question":"In addition to the established theatres subsidized by the city administration, Budapest should also provide financial resources for independent theatres and cultural workshops.","description":"Budapest maintains and supports 11 theaters.

Furthermore, fees are not calculated in a transparent way. Others believe low fees are a good way to support such programs.","order":26},{"id":"127","name":"Skyscrapers","question":"Budapest does not need skyscrapers.","description":"Many believe that Budapest should preserve its skyline by maintaining the prohibition of skyscrapers, and make no exemptions. Others believe that in certain cases buildings over 90 meters should be permitted.","order":27},{"id":"128","name":"City Hall","question":"The Budapest City Hall building at Deák tér and the huge parking space next to it should become public areas.","description":"Some suggested that the huge parking area of the city hall should be turned into a park, and City Hall Itself could be opened for civil society organizations and community initiatives. Some would argue, there is no real demand for these measures.\\n\\n","order":28},{"id":"129","name":"Pedestrian zones","question":"Green, car-free pedestrian zones should be created both in the city center and in other central areas of Budapest.","description":"Many would love to see huge pedestrian zones in the city center and in central areas of Budapest\'s districts.

Others say this is not the competency of the city administration and cannot be implemented.","order":32},{"id":"133","name":"Governmental district Buda castle","question":"The transformation of the castle district into a government quarter is a senseless and damaging prestige investment, which must not be supported by the city administration.","description":"Some experts say the castle district is not suitable for the placement of several state institutions, and these investments are incredibly expensive and do not serve the interests of those who live there. Others argue that the castle district is an appropriate place for the ministries, the constructions should be completed.","order":33},{"id":"134","name":"Comprehensible indicator system for measuring quality of life","question":"By the end of the next election cycle, the city administration should design a detailed, comprehensible and accountable indicator system for life satisfaction.","description":"Several cities have indicator system that set target values for livability aspects.

Others say, that this is not the duty of local governments to invest in such IT developments.","order":37},{"id":"138","name":"Free parking for up to 20 minutes","question":"Up to 20 minutes of free parking should be introduced in Budapest.","description":"Many people say, that the payment for short-term parking imposes an unnecessary burden on citizens; therefore it needs to be abolished.
